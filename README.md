# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Blog preview card coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Project Overview üìã 

This is my solution to the Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor.
The goal was to build a responsive component that matches the provided design as closely as possible, working well on both mobile and desktop devices.
This project served as a hands-on exercise to review and strengthen my earlier HTML and CSS skills.
